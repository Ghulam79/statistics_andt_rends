To solve this problem, we need to analyze a dataset by creating specific types of plots and computing statistical moments. The solution involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.
Approach

    1. Data Selection: Choose a dataset that allows for varied analysis. We selected the diabetes dataset from Kaggle, which includes attributes like LDL, HDL, BMI, Glucose, BloodPressure, HbA1c,	Triglycerides, WaistCircumference etc. in excel sheet.

    2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, filter out invalid entries, and ensure correct data types.

    3. Statistical Moments: Compute the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis for key numerical variables to understand their distributions.

    Visualization: Create a relational plot (scatter plot), a categorical plot (histogram), and a statistical plot (correlation heatmap) to visualize relationships and distributions in the data.

Solution Code is in visuals.py file.


To run the code,
1. Inslall the latest version of python.
2. Create virtual environment.
3. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. Run "python visuals.py"
